        Your task:
        - Give no more than **3 bullet points** for each category.
        - Use simple language and keep each bullet **short and actionable**.
        - Categories to include (if relevant): "Lifestyle Tips", "Vaccines to Get", "Screenings to Schedule"
        - Avoid long explanations or detailed medical advice.
        - Keep it friendly and supportive.
        - Do not add any bolding since the website will not show this, just make new lines for each category
